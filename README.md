> **Every place has a story. Every story has a place.**

A location-based storytelling app that reveals the hidden layer of stories in your world.

## What is RoguePoints?

Imagine pulling up a map of your town — but instead of boring street names, every pin tells a story:

- 📍 *"This is where we tried to sled down the golf course and got chased by security"*
- 👻 *"People say a ghost lives in the bathroom at this diner"*  
- 🎭 *"The final showdown of the senior prank war happened right here"*

RoguePoints creates a secret layer of community stories overlaid on the real world. It's part treasure hunt, part time capsile, part inside joke — and completely addictive to explore.
